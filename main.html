	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of the input. efficient algorithms are those that perform operations in minimal time, especially as the input size grows. Understanding time complexity helps in evaluating the scalability of an algorithm.</p>
 
	<p> <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of the input. An algorithm with a space complexity of O(n). means that the memory required grows linearly with the input size. Space efficiency is just as important as time efficiency in algorithm design, especially when handling large datasets. </p>
